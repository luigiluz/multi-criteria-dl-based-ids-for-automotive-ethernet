# multi-criteria-dl-based-ids-for-automotive-ethernet
This repository contains the source code regarding the implementation of the paper entitled "Multi-Criteria Optimized Deep Learning-based Intrusion Detection System for Detecting Cyberattacks in Automotive Ethernet Networks" submitted for the SBRC 2023

This repository contains the following jupyter notebooks:

- Multi-criteria optimized Dl-based IDS for Automotive Ethernet

This jupyter notebook uses our version of the LilNetX framework available in the following repository: [Our version of LilNetX](https://github.com/luigiluz/LilNetX).

This notebook acts as an server to execute the code related with the training and optimization of our DL-based IDS.

- Number of channels visualizer

This jupyter notebook loads a checkpoint generated by the first notebook and visualizes the updated number of channels and number of weights of the optimized network.
